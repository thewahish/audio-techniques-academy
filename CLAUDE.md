## Quality Standards

## Development Rules
**RULE OF THUMB**: Any time an HTML file is generated or modified, ALWAYS open it immediately to verify the output and ensure it displays correctly.

## Multilingual Design Rules
**PREFERRED APPROACH**: Use unified single-page solution with dynamic language switching instead of separate files.

**Benefits of Unified Approach**:
- Single file to maintain (no duplication)
- Guaranteed consistency between languages
- Better user experience with instant switching
- No broken links between language versions
- Easier updates and maintenance

**Implementation**:
- Use data attributes (data-en, data-ar) for all translatable content
- JavaScript function to switch content dynamically
- CSS transitions for smooth direction changes (LTR ↔ RTL)
- Single set of images and styling

**Fallback**: If separate files needed, ensure identical formatting and design between Arabic and English versions

## Name Conventions
**IMPORTANT**: Obai Sukar's name should ALWAYS be written as "Obai" in both English and Arabic versions. Never translate to "عبي" - always keep as "Obai" even in Arabic text.

## Image Selection Rules
**CRITICAL RULE**: When selecting images for websites and presentations, always choose:
- **Relatable and relevant** images that directly relate to the content/function
- **Professional and modern** appearance suitable for business/government use
- **Trendy and current** design that looks contemporary
- **Working/functional** image links that actually load properly
- **Correct colors**: Gold should be GOLD colored, not green or other wrong colors
- **Avoid**: Random unrelated images (dresses, cookies, etc.), broken links, outdated designs
- **Prefer**: Icons8.com fluency style for reliable, professional, modern icons that relate to audio engineering, training, government, business, etc.

## Quality Audit Process
**MANDATORY**: Before presenting any work, ALWAYS:
1. **Test all image links** - verify every image actually loads by opening the page
2. **Check both language versions** - English AND Arabic pages
3. **Verify color accuracy** - medals/trophies should have correct colors (bronze, silver, gold)
4. **Confirm relevance** - ensure all images relate to their function
5. **Open and review** - actually view the final pages before showing user
6. **BROKEN LINK PREVENTION RULE**: If ANY images show as broken in the browser, immediately fix with alternative working URLs before proceeding

## Image Link Testing Protocol
**CRITICAL**: Icons8 links frequently break. When any image doesn't display:
1. **First try**: Change size from /96/ to /48/ to /64/
2. **If still broken**: Use reliable emoji alternatives or Unicode symbols
3. **Test immediately**: Always open the page after changes to verify display
4. **NEVER present work with broken images** - this is completely unacceptable

## Content Protection Rule
**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL**: NEVER remove, shorten, or reduce any content that has been previously agreed upon and approved. This includes:
- Course curriculum items
- Technical glossary entries  
- Detailed course information
- Any sections or features that were working correctly

**If content needs modification**: Ask for explicit permission first and explain why changes are needed.
**If unsure**: Always err on the side of keeping MORE content rather than less.
**Violation of this rule is completely unacceptable.**
